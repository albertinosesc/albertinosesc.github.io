2023-02-17

	* Revision: 383
	- re-install the speaker icon in the menu bar which not only mutes but also
	removes sync data and recomputes score tempo. It also stops playback and
	moves the cursor to the last start position
	- a second mute symbol before the volume slider in the audio menu. This button
	only mutes audio.

2023-02-16

	* Revision: 381
	- removed opt.audOn (mute) option
	- added opt.syncon option (default true). When false the synchronization data
	is not used and the score tempos are re-computed (and playback halts).
	- added an (advanced) checkbox: "Use sync data" that sets the sycon option
	- the audio volume slider also has a mute button to the left, which, when
	activated, sets the volume to zero. When the volume is zeroed with the
	volume slider, the mute button is also activated (for iOS). The mute button
	remembers the volume before mute and resets that volume when deactivated.
	- removed global variable "latency", and corrected a related bug
	- audio speed correction is only applied when opt.syncon is true.
